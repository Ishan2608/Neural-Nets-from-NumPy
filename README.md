# Neural Network from Scratch with NumPy

- This repository contains code for building and training a neural network from scratch using NumPy. The neural network is trained on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
- Another code it contains takes a person through the general idea of building a neural network for classical Regression and Classification tasks. The file name is ANN_Core_Implementation.ipynb

## Overview

In this project, we implement a simple feedforward neural network architecture with one hidden layer. The neural network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm and optimized using gradient descent. We preprocess the MNIST dataset, normalize the pixel values, and train the model to classify handwritten digits.

## Key Features

- Implementation of a neural network from scratch using NumPy.
- Training on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
- Visualization of training loss, accuracy, and other metrics using Matplotlib.
- Evaluation of model performance on test data.

## Usage

You can customize the neural network architecture, hyperparameters, and training settings by modifying the `main.py` file. Additionally, you can explore different visualization techniques using Matplotlib to gain insights into the model's behavior and performance.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have any ideas for improvements or new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
